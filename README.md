# OOPS

# Certainly not every good program is object-oriented, and not every object-oriented program is good.

## And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. (Roald Dahl) 

## It's still magic even if you know how it's done. (Terry Pratchett, A Hat Full of Sky)
